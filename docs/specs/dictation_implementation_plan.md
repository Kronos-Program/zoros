# ZorOS Dictation Implementation Plan

## Vision

Improve the dictation capture and processing pipeline to provide high-fidelity, low-friction input streams that seamlessly seed Fibers, Threads, and Flows in ZorOS.

## Specific Goals

| Goal                               | Description                                                     |
| :--------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------- |
| High-Fidelity Capture              | Record voice/text clearly and reliably                          |
| Fast and Slow Transcription Passes | Quick draft immediately; deeper second-pass transcription later |
| Noise Handling                     | Reduce errors from ambient noise, stutters, filler words        |
| Vocab Familiarity                  | Prioritize personal frequent words or technical terms           |
| Contextual Enhancement             | Enrich understanding of concepts (e.g., scheduling, reminders)  |
| Confidence and Error Metrics       | Identify uncertainty in transcription                           |
| Chunking and Structuring           | Split dictations into discrete actionable ideas                 |
| Memory and Searchability           | Retain original audio/text for review                           |

## Implementation Phases

### Step 1: Raw Capture Pipeline

* Ingest audio or text input
* Save immediately as Draft Dictation
* Capture metadata: timestamp, source type, environment indicators

### Step 2: Fast Transcription Phase

* Use a **local model** (Whisper.cpp, SuperWhisper, etc.)
* Settings optimized for speed over perfect accuracy
* Output saved as `quick_transcript`

### Step 3: Deep Transcription Phase

* Re-process dictation with higher-accuracy settings:

  * Higher beam search
  * Punctuation restoration
  * Sentence boundary detection
* Output saved as `full_transcript`

### Step 4: Vocabulary and Attention Enhancement (Optional)

* Allow personal vocabulary injection
* Boost known names, technical terms, and frequent concepts
* Increase transcription fidelity by aligning to user context

### Step 5: Structuring and Chunking

* Post-transcription LLM pass to:

  * Chunk dictation into discrete actionable Fibers
  * Suggest Fiber seeds directly from dictation content

### Step 6: Feedback and Recovery

* Retain links to:

  * Raw audio/text capture
  * Fast and full transcripts
  * Summarized chunked actions
* Allow user review, correction, or manual linking into Threads

## Optional Future Enhancements

* Sentiment/emotion tagging (urgency detection)
* Context-sensitive routing (classify as note, reminder, event)
* Personal voice profile adaptation for better recognition

## Summary of Processing Flow

```
Capture Raw Input -> Fast Transcription -> Deep Transcription -> Chunking -> Linking to Fibers -> User Review
```

**Summary**: A frictionless dictation system becomes the heartbeat of ZorOS, ensuring spontaneous thought is cleanly captured, structured, and integrated into the personal orchestration graph.
